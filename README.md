Conversion Rates Analysis

In this Tableau project, I analized user conversion rates in Tableau.

Using the provided dataset, I created calculated components such as: registered users, first payments, users who started a trial period, and conversion rates for trial period and first payment made. I implemented the calculated components in creating visualisation for reflecting the time passed between the registration step and first payment placed. Dashboard also reflects total amount of users and conversion rate.
